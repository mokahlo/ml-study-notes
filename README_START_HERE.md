## 💡 Success Tips

### Study Smart
1. **Use multiple resources** - Theory from PDF, practice from notebook, problems for testing
2. **Active learning** - Run notebooks, modify code, create variations
3. **Spaced repetition** - Review same topics on different days
4. **Teach it back** - Explain concepts aloud or to others
5. **Connect concepts** - See how topics relate to each other

### Time Management
1. **Prioritize** - Start with critical files (CNN first)
2. **Allocate time** - 40% CNN, 30% NN, 20% advanced, 10% other
3. **Break it up** - 2-3 hour study sessions with breaks
4. **Mix activities** - Reading → Notebooks → Problems → Review

### Exam Day
1. **Review formulas** - Skim cheat-sheet.txt morning of exam
2. **Visualize practice** - Think through example problems
3. **Recall notebooks** - Remember how code implements concepts
4. **Trust preparation** - You have everything you need!
