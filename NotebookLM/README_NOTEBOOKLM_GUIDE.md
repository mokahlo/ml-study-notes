## Recommended Study Workflow in NotebookLM

### Phase 1: Foundations (30-45 minutes)
1. Upload: `STUDY_GUIDE.md` + `concept-review.md`
2. Ask NotebookLM:
   - "What are the 5 most important concepts for this exam?"
   - "Create a mind map of neural network types"
   - "What's the difference between feedforward and CNNs?"

### Phase 2: Practical Understanding (45-60 minutes)
1. Add: `Diabetes_ANN_MZA.ipynb` + `CNN_MZA.ipynb`
2. Ask NotebookLM:
   - "Walk me through how a neural network is built step by step"
   - "What does each layer in a CNN do?"
   - "Generate practice problems about the code in these notebooks"

### Phase 3: Advanced Topics (30-45 minutes)
1. Add: `Transformer_MZA.ipynb` + `HW5_Traffic_Sign_Classification_MZA.ipynb`
2. Ask NotebookLM:
   - "Compare how CNNs and Transformers process data"
   - "What are the key differences in their applications?"
   - "Create a quiz comparing these architectures"

### Phase 4: Practice & Reinforcement (30-45 minutes)
1. Upload: `practice-problems.md`
2. Ask NotebookLM:
   - "Create 10 new problems based on these solutions"
   - "Generate a practice exam with mixed difficulty"
   - "Explain the solutions to these problems"

## Smart NotebookLM Prompts to Try

### For Concept Clarity
```
"Using the study guide and notebooks, create an explanation of [topic] 
that a 10-year-old could understand. Then explain it at expert level."
```

### For Problem Solving
```
"Based on the practice problems, what are the most common mistake patterns?
Create corrected versions with explanations."
```

### For Exam Preparation
```
"Create a comprehensive practice exam with 20 questions covering:

## Files Not Included (Why)

### PDFs/Materials Excluded
- ❌ `Transformers.pptx` - NotebookLM works better with text-based PDFs
- ❌ `PCA_MZA.ipynb` - Not core to midterm (covered in earlier class)
- ❌ Advanced transfer learning PDFs - Secondary topics
- ❌ Training optimization PDFs - Reference material (cheatsheet has key points)

### Why These Specific Files Were Selected
✅ **Study guides** → High-level overview + organization
✅ **Concept reviews** → Theoretical foundation
✅ **Practice problems** → Active learning opportunities
✅ **Key PDFs** → Lecture material for context
✅ **4 notebooks** → Progression from simple to complex
✅ **Cheatsheet** → Quick formula reference

## Tips for Best Results

### ✅ DO:
- Ask follow-up questions on concepts you don't understand
- Request NotebookLM to create custom quizzes
- Use it to explain code concepts
- Ask for comparisons between different approaches
- Request visual summaries (tables, diagrams)

### ❌ DON'T:
- Upload more than 20 files at once (slows processing)
- Ask for Python code generation (use notebooks as reference instead)
- Use it as a substitute for reading the materials
- Expect perfect answers—verify with the study guide

## Troubleshooting

**Q: NotebookLM isn't understanding my questions?**
- A: Be more specific. Instead of "Explain CNNs", try "Explain how the convolution operation works in the CNN_MZA.ipynb notebook"

**Q: Too many files uploaded, service is slow?**
- A: Start with Tier 1 files only, add others as needed

**Q: Can't upload a file?**
- A: Some file formats may not be supported. Prioritize PDFs and notebooks
