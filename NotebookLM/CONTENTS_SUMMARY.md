## 📞 Troubleshooting

**Files won't upload?**
- Check file size limits (usually 2-3 MB per file)
- Notebooks may need to be converted to PDF if size is issue

**NotebookLM slow?**
- Start with fewer files (use Tier 1)
- Add more files after initial learning

**Need more practice?**
- NotebookLM can generate unlimited problems based on the practice-problems.md file
- Ask: "Generate 50 new practice problems based on these"
