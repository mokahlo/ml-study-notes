## 🔄 Comparison: Lab vs Homework Notebooks

### Lab Notebooks (In-class demonstrations)
- Focus: Concept explanation with examples
- Instructor-created, step-by-step walkthrough
- Show "here's how to do it"
- Often include visualizations and explanations
- Purpose: Learning by example

### Homework Notebooks (Student assignments)
- Focus: Problem solving and implementation
- Student-created solutions with detailed annotations
- Show "here's a complete solution"
- Include full project lifecycle (data → model → evaluation)
- Purpose: Practical application and assessment

**Both are valuable**: Labs show HOW, Homeworks show COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION
