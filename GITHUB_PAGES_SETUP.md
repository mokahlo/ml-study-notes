## Troubleshooting

**"Site not found"?**
- Wait 5 minutes for GitHub to deploy
- Check URL spelling (yourusername, not "username")
- Refresh page (Ctrl+Shift+R on computer, hard refresh on phone)

**Progress not syncing between devices?**
- This is expected! Each device has separate storage
- You can manually transfer progress via export (would need to add feature)

**Want to share with study partner?**
- Change repo to "Public"
- Share URL with them
- OR add them as collaborator (Settings → Collaborators)
